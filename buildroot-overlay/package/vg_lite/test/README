VeriSilicon VGLite Conformance Test Suite

1. Build CTS test suite

    a) Export VIVANTE_SDK_DIR environment variable to specify VGLite SDK directory that
       includes VGLite heaader and driver libraries.

    b) Export CROSS_COMPILE environment variable according to your build environment.

    c) Run "build_sample.sh" script to build CTS tests.

        ./build_sample.sh

       All CTS tests and libaries will be installed to $VIVANTE_SDK_DIR/samples/...

2. Run CTS test and check the results

    a) Copy $VIVANTE_SDK_DIR/* to the target system (RT500), such as ~/VGLite/...

    b) Insert VGLite kernel driver on the target system.

        cd ~/VGLite/drivers
        insmod vg_lite.ko

    c) Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH on the target system.

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/VGLite/drivers:~/VGLite/samples

    d) Copy the golden image directory "./reference" to ~/VGLite/samples on the target system.
   
    e) Edit the "VGLite_CTS.sh" script, set GOLDEN_PATH to the reference image directory.

        GOLDEN_PATH=~/VGLite/samples/reference

    e) Copy the "VGLite_CTS.sh" script to ~/VGLite/samples/ on the target system.
    
    f) Run the "VGLite_CTS.sh" script to launch VGLite CTS.

        ./VGLite_CTS.sh

       It will run through all CTS test cases and compare the render result with reference golden
       image. The CTS test report will be displayed after the CTS run completes.
